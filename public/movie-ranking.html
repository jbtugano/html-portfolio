<h3>Facing the Giants</h3>
<p>A heartwarming Christian movie that shows we can overcome giants in our lives through faith in God.</p>
<h3>Godzilla</h3>
<p>I grew up watching dinoasur movies and having some interests in them.</p>
<h3>Passion of the Christ</h3>
<p>A hardcore movie and rated-R one but a powerful movie illustrating the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
